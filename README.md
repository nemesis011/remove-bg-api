## Usage

### Deployment

This example is made to work with the Serverless Framework

#### Pre-requisites

SLS must be pre-installed.

Equally `aws-cli` must be installed and configured with an AWS account

#### Deployment process

* Edit the serverless.yml with the correct region and profile
* Create a `.env file and populate it with the below info from the [remove.bg API](https://www.remove.bg) docs
```
// .env
REMOVE_BG_KEY=
REMOVE_BG_API_PATH=https://api.remove.bg/v1.0/removebg
```

* Run the following command

```bash
serverless deploy
```



### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can call the created application via HTTP:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url {url} \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "image_url": "https://www.remove.bg/example.jpg",
    "image_size": "auto",
    "image_filename": "example.jpg"
  }
'
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "message": "Processed image file succesfully uploaded",
  "url": "{signed-url}"
}
```

### Local development

You can invoke your function locally by using the following command:

```bash
serverless invoke local --function remove-bg --path payloads/example.json
```

### Testing

Use the sample payload with API client software like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/products/insomnia) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/) or [Postwoman](https://post.liubing.me) to test the deployed function.
